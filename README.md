# Endless Pots
Wait a minute...! There are endlessly rotating pots? But how does that work and why did I and the internet not know about them?

We recently stumbled across the existence of endless pots, analog rotary potentiometers that can be turned not just once but an infinite number of times. These can be used to read out the absolute position (and thus also relative angle changes over time) with high accuracy (analog read out).
They exist - and no, we don't mean rotary encoders, which usually have a poor operating feel and can only measure rotation digitally and in discrete steps. And when we realized that the internet seems to know next to nothing about them, we decided to share our researched knowledge so that everyone can use these great components.

# The Story
Please check out this post about background infos on this special pot:

# The Code
This is a basic Arduino (C++) code, using an Arduino library reading the analog values, smoothing them (ResponsiveAnalogRead), returning the absolute position and sending it (exemplary) as MIDI to a computer.
